            party sites and other information which you submit to us through the Service, or any part

        <h3>Is my data being shared outside of Invincible Infra?</h3>
        <p>
            In some cases, we share some of your personal data with external services that we need to run
            our own services. These services include Auth0, an identity-as-a-service provider to which we
            delegate the authentication functions of our services. Therefore, Auth0 has access to all users’
            email addresses and encrypted copies of their passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of any choices you make regarding your personal data, Invincible Infra may disclose
            personal data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (i) in connection with
            any legal investigation; (ii) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants
            served on Invincible Infra; (iii) to protect or defend the rights or property of Invincible Infra or users
            of the Site or Services; and/or (iv) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential
            violation of the law, this policy, or our <a href="https://www.globestack.io/tos.html">Terms of Use</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that we do not share your personal data with any other party. We are not selling or
            trading your personal data with any third party.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Do we transfer data outside of your country?</h3>
        <p>
            Your information, including personal data that we collect from you, will be transferred to, stored
            at, and processed by us and other third parties outside of the country in which you reside,
            including, but not limited to the United States. By using our services you agree to this transfer,
            storing, and processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in
            accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Do we collect personal data from children?</h3>
        <p>
            We do not intentionally gather personal data from visitors who are under the age of 16. If you
            believe that we might have done so, please contact us immediately.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>How long is my data being kept?</h3>
        <p>
            As long as you are an active user on Invincible Infra we keep your personal data. However, we
            realize that users come and go and we do not intend on holding on to your personal data
            forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inactivity is considered someone who has ceased use of the services for 2 years. Typically this
            means that after noticing that you are a non-active and non-paying user for 2 years, we will
            remind you of your account. After attempting to reach out without any response, we will delete
            your personal data permanently.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>How do we protect your personal data?</h3>
        <p>
            The security of your personal data is important to us. We seek to use reasonable organizational,
            technical, and administrative measures to protect personal data within our organization:
        </p>
        <p>
            </p><ul>
                <li>
                    When you enter sensitive data (such as a credit card number), your information is sent
                    over an authenticated and encrypted connection using <b>HTTPS</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We store your personal data only on servers with limited access that are located in
                    controlled facilities and use a variety of technologies and procedures intended to protect
                    your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration,
                    and destruction.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Nonetheless, no communication via the Internet can ever be 100% secure, and no security
            measures are guaranteed to be effective. Accordingly, you are advised to use caution and
            discretion when determining what personal information to disclose to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if
            you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised),
            please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us via telephone or email.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Should I share sensitive personal data while using the service?</h3>
        <p>
            We ask that you not send us and that you do not disclose any sensitive personal data (e.g.,
            social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious
            or other beliefs, health information, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or
            trade union membership) on or through the services or otherwise to us. If you send or disclose
            any sensitive personal data to us when you submit user generated content to the services, you

        <p>
            We may share some or all of your personal data in connection with or during negotiation of any

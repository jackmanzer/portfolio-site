          The promise of the internet is to make information instantly

        <p class="about-p-base-style">
          Too often, web pages and apps are slow and clunky for anyone not
          using the latest iPhone with a 5G connection from a Western country.
          This makes for frustrated users and lost sales for businesses.

          But obtaining consistently high global performance for complex
          applications is no simple matter. The tech giants have legions of
          engineers optimizing their apps, but how can startups with fewer
          resources achieve the same level of speed?
        </p>
        <p class="about-p-base-style">
          We believe that startups deserve an infrastructure platform that
          takes care of all the hard parts of global performance 'behind the
          scenes' so that they can focus their energies on their own products.
        </p>
        <p class="about-p-base-style">
          Specifically, a global infrastructure platform should:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            free the developer from the nuisance of optimizations - you
            shouldn't need to manually tune a bloated webpack config file to
            get good global performance for your webapp; the platform should
            take care of that for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            provide fast, rock-solid SLAs - developer's deserve a host that
            actually serves their content at the edge with consistently high
            performance 100% of the time, not the standard CDN deal from today
            that basically says: "we'll keep your content at the edge whenever
            we feel like it is convenient for us, and when it's inconvenient
            we'll just slow down your site without telling you."
          </li>
          <li>
            abstract away the architectural complexity of muti-region
            applications so that developers can focus on writing the code that
            makes their business go, not messing around with convoluted
            architecture diagrams and wrangling cloudformation templates.
            Google 'aws multi-region deployment' to get a feel for how
            complicated things are today - we want to change that for the
            better.
          </li>
          <li>
            provide trustworthy, transparent global monitoring - you should be
            able to measure how well your site is performing all over the
            world with just a few clicks. If the performance isn't where you
            want it to be, the platform should provide guidance to help you on
            your way.

          Our mission is to build GlobeStack into a platform that does all
          these things and more. We're starting out tackling one aspect at a
          time, and we've decided to focus on the monitoring piece first - you

        <h2>3. Invincible Infra Plans and Purchase Terms</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Plans</h3>
        <p>
            The features and price of your access to the Service is determined by the creation of an account
            and payment upon account creation (a “Plan”)—to review the features and price associated with
            Invincible Infra’s Plans, please visit <a href="https://www.globestack.io/">https://www.globestack.io</a>. No contract will exist between
            you and Invincible Infra until an account is created and the fee is paid.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Fees</h3>
        <p>
            The License provided once the account has been created and all fees are paid is expressly
            conditioned on timely payment of the then-applicable license fee. We may include a separate
            charge for any applicable sales, use, value-added, or excise taxes, and any other similar taxes,
            duties or charges of any kind. We will remit taxes collected, if any, to the appropriate taxing
            authority. If payment is not received within the required time period, we may suspend your
            access to the Service until payment is received. Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees are
            non-refundable. We reserve the right to increase or decrease any fee at any time; however, to
            the extent you have paid your fee in advance, the increase or decrease will not become
            effective for your Plan until the end of your current Term or your next renewal.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Auto-Renewal for Services</h3>
        <p>
            Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, your Plan will be automatically extended following any term,
            for the same period of time as the original term, at the then-current rate. To change or terminate
            your Plan, go to your Account page or contact us at support@globestack.io. If you terminate
            your Plan during the term, you may use your Plan until the end of the then-current term and
            your Plan will not be renewed after the then-current term expires.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Payment terms</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Payment of Fees</h3>
        <p>
            Plan holders agree to pay the course fee specified when you purchase a Plan. Depending on
            the Plan purchased, your payment terms will be issued at time of payment, or through an
            invoice with specific payment terms. Depending on where you transact with us and the type of
            payment method used your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or
            differences in prices because of exchange rates and other geographic-specific pricing. Any
            agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your specified payment
            method. Your failure to terminate and/or continued use of your Plan reaffirms that we are
            authorized to charge you for that Plan.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.2 Third-Party Payment Processors</h3>
        <p>
            You agree to pay us, through our payment processors, all charges at the prices then in effect for
            any purchase in accordance with the applicable payment terms presented to you at the time of
            purchase. We reserve the right to correct, or to instruct our payment processor or financing
            partner to correct, any errors or mistakes, even if payment has already been requested or
            received.
        </p>


        <h2>5. Cancellation &amp; Termination</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Termination</h3>
        <p>
            You agree that we may deactivate or terminate your rights to use the Service (including your
            Account) or terminate your Plan (i) if we believe that you have breached or acted inconsistently
            with these Terms and (ii) at any time for any reason at our sole discretion. You agree that any
            such deactivation or termination for the foregoing reasons may be effected without prior notice
            to you and that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any deactivation of your Account

            cancellation, your Plan will remain active to the end of your then-current Term to the extent your
            Plan fee is paid. We will not offer refunds on any fees or charges related to your Plan—this
            includes any partially used or unused periods for which you have already paid. Your obligation
            to pay fees continues through the end of your Individual Term.
        </p>
        <h3>5.3 Post-termination or cancellation</h3>
        <p>
            These Terms will continue in effect until termination or expiration of your Account or Plan. Upon
            termination or expiration your rights under these Terms, your Account and right to access and
            use the Service will terminate immediately. Termination or expiration may involve deletion of
            your User Content associated with your Account. Invincible Infra will not have any liability
            whatsoever to you for any termination of your rights under these Terms, including for
            termination of your Account or deletion of your User Content. Even after your rights under these
            Terms are terminated, the following Sections will remain in effect: 5 (Cancellation &amp;
            Termination) 6.1(User Content), 7 (IP), 8 (Indemnification) through 12 (General).
